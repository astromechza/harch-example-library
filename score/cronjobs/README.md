Define `schedules` under which the Workload should run as a [Kubernetes CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/Workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/).

Refer to the [schedules feature](https://developer.humanitec.com/integration-and-extensions/workload-profiles/features/#humanitecschedules) for configuration details.

The Score extension file specifies the `humanitec/default-cronjob` Workload Profile to use which supports the feature.
